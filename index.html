            </header>
            <p>From putting together legos as a kid to graduating college with a degree in music composition, I have felt the need to create. As I've continued to create things such as music compositions, art projects, and woodworking projects, I have discovered that I enjoy creating web projects as well! I'm greatly looking forward to an opportunity with Thinkful to continue to grow my knowledge and skills in web development.</p>

            <p>Two of the most important things I've learned over the past 7 years spent as a sign-maker is that having effective communication and an ability to work alongside others are key attributes in any profession. I look forward to continuing to grow these valuable lifelong skills wiht my peers as I work through the Thinkful Software Engineering Bootcamp.</p>

            <p>When I'm not creating, I can usually be found in the outdoors. Living in the Pacific Northwest, I've taken advantage of the recreational opportunities that are at my disposal.</p>
            <p>A few of the activities I've been fortunate to take part in:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Camping</li>
              <li>Backpacking</li>
              <li>Hiking</li>
              <li>Kayaking</li>
              <li>Paddleboarding</li>
              <li>Rollerblading</li>
              <li>Cross-country skiing</li>
              <li>Biking</li>
            </ul>
